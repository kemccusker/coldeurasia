\begin{abstract}
Arctic sea ice loss has been implicated in the recent trend toward unusually cold Eurasian winters \cite{liu12,mori14,kim14}. Whether the linkage follows from anthropogenic sea ice loss, however, remains an open question as the sea-ice loss combines anthropogenic response and internal (random) variability \cite{swart15,wettstein14} and because of confounding wintertime variability over the Eurasian continent \cite{deser12b,screen14a}. Here, we isolate the anthropogenic and random components of the linkage using a large ensemble of atmosphere-only model simulations with prescribed sea ice loss taken from simulations of the companion atmosphere-ocean-cryosphere model and from observations. We find no evidence of a sea-ice loss related decrease in Eurasian winter temperature. However, we do find long periods of winter Eurasian cooling linked to internally-generated circulation features over the Barents and Kara Seas regions of the Arctic. These results challenge the perception that Arctic sea ice loss was responsible for the recent prevalence of unusually cold Eurasian winters, showing instead that these winters were more likely the consequence of internal variability, with implications for our understanding of impacts and adaptation in human and natural high-northern latitude systems. %We find no evidence of a sea-ice loss related increase in the prevalence of cold Eurasian winters.
\end{abstract}

Northern hemisphere winter (December-February; DJF) temperatures have been increasing at a rate of @@$^\circ$C/decade since 1979. The majority of this warming can be attributed to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (@@cite) combined with positive feedbacks related to the loss of Arctic sea ice (@@cite). Epoch differences of surface air temperature (SAT) between 2002-12 and 1979-89 reveal warming upward of 2$^\circ$C over the polar cap, collocated with areas of sea ice loss (Figure \ref{fig:fig1}a). Contemporaneous cooling of greater than 1$^\circ$C over the Eurasian continent in winter is also evident; a feature that is particularly striking when considered in the context of broad hemispheric warming. 

Since the year 2000, Eurasian winters have shown a greater propensity toward anomalous cold in relation to the evolution of northern hemisphere temperature (Figure \ref{fig:fig1}b), while coincident, large reductions in autumn and winter Arctic sea ice area, particularly in the Barents and Kara Seas sector (along the eastern half of the Russian coastline), have occurred. Nine of the ten lowest winter areas have occurred since the year 2000 (Figure \ref{fig:fig1}c). Low sea ice concentration in the Barents-Kara Seas (BKS) has been linked to anomalously cold Eurasian SAT through a Rossby wave-train emanating out of the BKS region, incited by turbulent heat flux from an increased area of open water \cite{honda09,mori14,kim14,peings14}. 

While human influence on observed Arctic sea ice extent is clear \cite{min08}, interpretation of this Arctic sea ice--Eurasian SAT connection as an anthropogenic signal is limited by the strong imprint of internal variability on observed sea ice loss itself \cite{swart15}. What is the anthropogenic contribution to observed winter sea-ice loss? To estimate this, we examine a distribution of DJF sea ice loss between the periods (1979-89) and (2002-12) in a large ensemble (LE) of 50 Historical simulations executed in the Canadian Earth System model version 2 (CanESM2; Figure \ref{fig:fig2}). The anthropogenically-forced sea ice area anomaly is represented by the average of the distribution, while an individual realization represents one version of ``observations" that is displaced from the mean by some amount due only to internally-generated variability. Here internal variability generates a range in DJF sea ice loss of $~$1 million km$^2$.

Taking the extremes of the distribution as two versions of ``observations", this distance can account for up to approximately 40\% of the anthropogenic sea ice area anomaly. Satellite-derived Arctic sea ice area from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) is encompassed by the Historical LE and indicates a similar contribution of internal variability (36\%), roughly comparable to previous estimates of $~$47-57\% made for September sea ice trends \cite{kay11,stroeve07}.

%; internal variability may contribute as much as $~$50\% of the magnitude of the observed trend in September \cite{stroeve07,kay11}. Similarly, in a large ensemble (LE) of 50 Historical simulations executed in the Canadian Earth System model, version 2 (CanESM2), internal variability accounts for a range of DJF sea ice loss between the periods (1979-89) and (2002-12) of approximately 1 million km$^2$ (Figure \ref{fig:fig2}), with a distribution mean equal to -1.22e$^6$ km$^2$. To estimate the maximum contribution that internal variability could have on the sea ice area anomaly, we assume the ``true" sea ice area anomaly is the distribution mean (-1.22$^6$ km$^2$) and the ``observation" of sea ice loss is the minimum (-1.70$^6$ km$^2$) or maximum (-0.71$^6$ km$^2$). This gives a contribution of internal variability of -1.22e$^6$ km$^2$ / -1.70$^6$ km$^2$ or 72\%
%each of the extreme sea ice area anomalies (-1.70$^6$ km$^2$ and -0.71$^6$ km$^2$, for minimum and maximum respectively) is ``observations" indicates the maximum contribution of internal variability to the sea ice area anomaly, in this model. 

%A clear anthropogenic signal in Arctic sea ice area changes during winter since 1979 is also evident in a comparison of a 50-member ensemble of simulations performed in the Canadian Earth System Model v2 (CanESM2) forced with all historical forcings (Historical; see Methods) versus 50 CanESM2 simulations forced with only natural forcings (HistoricalNat; Figure \ref{fig:fig2}). Whereas natural forcing yields nearly equal chances of sea-ice growth and sea-ice loss between (2002-12) and (1979-89), including anthropogenic forcing always yields sea-ice loss even in the face of large internal variability as indicated by the spread in the Historical distribution. Simulated Historical winter Arctic sea-ice area anomalies are consistent with satellite measurements of the Arctic sea-ice area anomaly from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). 


%Observations represent one potential reality out of many possibilities due to the random evolution of internally-generated variability super-imposed on a forced .%, although observations fall on the less-ice-loss side of the distribution.

%An observational estimate of sea ice loss from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) is consistent with simulated Arctic sea ice loss, however we note that the Historical large ensemble (LE) average overestimates observed winter sea ice loss.

%Observations represent one potential reality out of many, and thus are not expected to fall in any particular place on the Historical distribution, however the CanESM2 Historical ensemble compares favourably with the NSIDC observations.

Observations represent just one potential reality out of many due to the evolution of internally-generated (``random") variability superimposed on a human-induced (``forced") evolution. We isolate the effect of human-induced Arctic sea ice loss on the atmosphere by executing a large ensemble of Canadian atmosphere general circulation model (CanAM4) simulations in which prescribed past (1979-89) and present-day (2002-12) boundary conditions are taken from an average of five CanESM2 Historical simulations (Figure \ref{fig:fig2} and Supplementary Figure 1; also see Methods). The average boundary conditions represent an estimate of the human-induced component by averaging out internal variability. 

A set of five 120-year AGCM simulations, differing only in initial conditions, is executed with annually-repeating, monthly sea-ice concentration (SIC), sea-ice thickness (SIT), and sea surface temperature (SST) for ``past" boundary conditions and for ``present-day" boundary conditions in which the only changes are Arctic SIC, SIT, and SST (where SIC $<$ 15\% in the present day but not the past). The anomalies between these ``Average SIC forcing" past and present-day simulations estimate the isolated response of the atmosphere to human-induced sea ice loss. We similarly execute five pairs of 120-year AGCM simulations with boundary conditions taken from the individual CanESM2 Historical simulations (``Individual SIC forcing" ensemble) to represent the response to varying boundary conditions that incorporate internal variability. Thus in total, each ensemble consists of 600 years of (present - past) anomalies. In addition, we execute a pair of 120-year simulations with past and present-day NSIDC boundary conditions (Supplementary Figure 1).

We first present the responses of regionally-averaged winter SAT from all simulations as ``uncertainty cascades" \cite{wilby10,swart15}, where uncertainty is based on the number of simulation years averaged (Figure \ref{fig:fig3}). This presentation demonstrates the powerful influence of internal variability. A reduction in SIC reveals newly open seawater that provides a source of heat to the atmosphere. Thus, the local effect of human-induced sea ice loss, averaged across the Average SIC forcing ensemble (600-year average), is a warming over the polar cap (averaged north of 60$^\circ$N) of just over 1$^\circ$C in winter (bottom of Figure \ref{fig:fig3}a). When considering instead the 120-year averaged SAT responses to Average SIC forcing, a spread in responses is evident that ranges from $~$0.9$^\circ$C to 1.3$^\circ$C. The spread of 60-year averages is larger still. 

This spread is noteworthy because, given the identical boundary conditions for each 120-year and 60-year average, the range of anomalies must be due solely to internal variability. Furthermore, the range of 120-year average SAT responses in the Individual SIC forcing ensemble (top of Figure \ref{fig:fig3}a) is comparable to that of the Average SIC forcing ensemble, indicating that even local sensitivity of SAT to varied sea ice loss conditions is overpowered by internal variability in winter.    % @@ supplementary to show it is not the case in SON?

%two reasons: i. because the boundary conditions for each 120-year and 60-year average are identical, the driver of the differences must be solely internal variability, and ii. each anomaly presented (600-year, 120-year, and 60-year average) is statistically significant at the 90\% level. The implication is that  one could be mislead as to the true response if a simulation was stopped after just 60-years, or even 100, as has been common practice (@@). 
%previous findings indicate that 60 years is sufficient to determine a robust, local SAT response to sea-ice loss (e.g. Ref. \cite{screen14a}), which these results do not support. Furthermore, the range of 120-year average SAT responses in the Individual SIC forcing ensemble is comparable to that of the Average SIC forcing ensemble, indicating that sensitivity of SAT to varied sea ice loss conditions is overpowered by internal variability, even locally, in winter. 
%Furthermore, each anomaly presented (600-year, 120-year, and 60-year average) is statistically significant at the 90\% level, which would lead one to believe
%--- for example, the 60-year average of the present day polar cap SAT is significantly different from the past polar cap SAT. Thus, 

Moving farther afield, the SAT response over Eurasia is not statistically different from zero in either the Individual or Average SIC forcing ensemble averages, indicating that the robust response of Eurasian winter temperature to human-induced Arctic sea-ice loss is not cooling, but rather no signal (Figure \ref{fig:fig3}b). Nevertheless, some 120-year and 60-year average anomalies show statistical significance, most notably the 60-year average cooling associated with NSIDC SIC forcing that is not robust to the 120-year average. This point is important to recognize because many studies understandably utilize 60- to 100-year integrations to draw conclusions that may prove inaccurate given larger ensemble sizes.%@@ need to say something about the fact that responses span zero....

Arctic sea ice loss can yield either warmer or cooler Eurasian SAT in winter, even with a large ensemble size of 120-years each, and even with identical boundary forcing (Figure \ref{fig:fig3}b). To understand this further, we examine the spatial pattern of circulation associated with the two ``extreme" cases of cold and warm SAT anomalies in the Average SIC forcing ensemble (Figure \ref{fig:fig4}). It is immediately apparent that the patterns of geopotential height at 500 hPa (Z500) are quite different from one another, and in some locations such as over the BKS, nearly opposite. The cooling case (Figure \ref{fig:fig4}a) shows a zonally-symmetric increase in Z500 to the north and a weak decrease over central Eurasia. This pattern is conducive for advection of polar air to the south and west along Z500 contours. In contrast, the warming case (Figure \ref{fig:fig4}b) exhibits an azonal pattern with a decrease in Z500 over the BKS region and increases over the southern continent and the northeast. This pattern favours warm-moist air advection from the south and west. Thus, the response of Eurasian SAT is consistent with thermal advection due to internally-varying circulation patterns.

The relationship between the winter circulation, in particular over the Barents-Kara Seas, and Eurasian SAT is genuine and exists across 120-year average anomalies (Figure \ref{fig:fig5}). As Z500 anomalies over the Barents-Kara Seas increase, Eurasian SAT anomalies robustly decrease (r$^2$=0.72; p=0.002). Moreover, the same relationship exists interannually between anomalies within each individual simulation pair (0.36 $<$ r$^2<$ 0.50; p $<$ 0.001). Thus, the physical mechanisms that lead to the Eurasian cooling case are consistent with existing work that implicates high geopotential heights over the Barents-Kara Seas region (cite@@). What is novel here, however, is that there is no indication that changes in sea-ice concentration are the fundamental origin of Eurasian SAT anomalies because sea-ice concentration is prescribed in our simulations.

In further support of this, we find no relationship between 120-year average BKS surface fluxes (turbulent or net flux) and Eurasian SAT (r$^2$=0.11; p=0.35), or BKS SAT and Eurasian SAT (r$^2$=0.13; p=0.31). This finding is consistent with \cite{woollings14} who found no relationship between BKS temperature and Eurasian blocking in CMIP5 models (@@remove or modify. there is a weak relationship in sims b/w BKS SAT and BKS Z500; p=0.08 @@). Furthermore, we find no change in the frequency distributions of yearly DJF averaged Eurasian SATs between the simulations with past sea-ice boundary forcing versus present-day sea-ice boundary forcing.

We have seen that neither human-induced sea-ice loss, nor observed sea-ice loss (@@refer to obs run in prev paragraphs) consistently causes Eurasian cooling in our simulations. Rather internal variability, even with a sample of 120 years, is the dominant effect because there is effectively no true signal in winter outside the Arctic. What, then, is the cause of Eurasian winter cooling in the observational record? Others have suggested changes in the North Atlantic SST \cite{sato14}, or increased blocking due to the phase of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and North American Oscillation \cite{peings14b}, both manifestations of internal variability in the climate system. Indeed, we find that the relationship between observed geopotential height over the Barents-Kara Seas and Eurasian SAT in winter (taken from ERA-Interim and GIStemp, respectively; see Methods) are consistent with internal variability within the CanESM2 Historical LE (Supplementary Figure \ref{fig:supp2b}). 

@@, when the northern hemisphere warm bias in CanESM2 is taken into account (Supplementary Figure \ref{fig:supp2b}).

%The relationship is furthermore present in the CanESM2 Historical Large Ensemble, in which all components of the model are active, all historical forcings are included, and hence many realizations of sea-ice loss are produced (Supplementary Figure \ref{fig:supp2}).


%FROM PREV VERSION Here, however, SST changes in the North Atlantic are held fixed and cannot be implicated as the root cause. We conclude that while the simulated early winter relationship between circulation over the BKS and Eurasian SAT is robust and consistent with expectations of temperature advection, it does not favour one sign or another when forced with Arctic sea-ice loss. Instead, the circulation response to human-induced sea ice loss and the average (human-induced) circulation response to variable sea-ice loss, which together we refer to as the robust response, is a more pan-Arctic increase in geopotential heights in ND that are not localized or particularly strong over the sensitive BKS region (supp fig?). 

%We find that the observed Z500 anomaly over the Barents-Kara Seas and the cold Eurasian winter anomaly is within the 5-95\% confidence range of the CanESM2 Historical Large Ensemble, when the warm-bias in northern hemisphere SAT is taken into account (Supplementary Figure \ref{fig:supp2b}).


%@@concluding remarks should include: something about how if sea-ice loss does nudge Eurasian SAT in one way or another, the signal would be much too small in reality to distinguish from natural variability anyway.

%The response of SAT over the polar cap (averaged north of 60$^\circ$N), where it is local to the sea ice loss, 

%Focusing on winter, we contrast the local response of SAT over the polar cap (Figure \ref{fig:fig3}a) with the remote response of Eurasian SAT (Figure \ref{fig:fig3}b)

%We first examine the response of SAT over the polar cap (averaged north of 60$^\circ$N) where it is local to the sea ice loss. Newly open seawaters provide a source of heat to the atmosphere, causing it to warm --- the Average SIC forcing ensemble mean, indicative of the response to human-induced sea ice loss, is a warming over the polar cap in winter (Figure \ref{fig:fig3}a). 

%The response of SAT in winter over the polar cap (averaged north of 60$^\circ$N) to human-induced sea ice loss is warming of just over 1$^\circ$C, indicated by the Average SIC forcing ensemble mean in Figure \ref{fig:fig3}a. 

%We show the response of regionally averaged SAT as an ``uncertainty cascade" \cite{wilby10,swart15} where uncertainty is based on number of years averaged. This presentation demonstrates the powerful and sometimes misleading effect of internal variability.

 %as well as demonstrate the powerful and sometimes misleading effect of internal variability

The average boundary conditions represent an estimate of the human-induced component of the boundary condition by averaging out internal variability. Pairs of simulations are executed with the CanESM2's associated Canadian AGCM (CanAM4) in which past (1979-89) and present-day (2002-12) Arctic sea-ice conditions from the five CanESM2 Historical ensemble members that are included as part of CMIP5 (Figure \ref{fig:fig2}) are prescribed as boundary conditions (see Methods).

The regression line ($r^2$ = 0.72, $p$ = 0.002) does not include the NSIDC SIC forcing simulation average.
