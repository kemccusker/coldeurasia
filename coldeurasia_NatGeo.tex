\begin{abstract}
Arctic sea ice loss has been implicated in the recent trend toward unusually cold Eurasian winters \cite{liu12,mori14,kim14}. Whether the linkage follows from anthropogenic sea ice loss, however, remains an open question as the sea-ice loss combines anthropogenic response and internal (random) variability \cite{swart15,wettstein14} and because of confounding wintertime variability over the Eurasian continent \cite{deser12b,screen14a}. Here, we isolate the anthropogenic and random components of the linkage using a large ensemble of atmosphere-only model simulations with prescribed sea ice loss taken from simulations of the companion atmosphere-ocean-cryosphere model. We find no evidence of a sea-ice loss related decrease in Eurasian winter temperature. However, we do find long periods of winter Eurasian cooling linked to internally-generated circulation features over the Barents and Kara Seas regions of the Arctic. These results challenge the perception that Arctic sea ice loss was responsible for the recent prevalence of unusually cold Eurasian winters, showing instead that these winters were more likely the consequence of internal variability, with implications for our understanding of impacts and adaptation in human and natural high-northern latitude systems. %We find no evidence of a sea-ice loss related increase in the prevalence of cold Eurasian winters.

Average northern hemisphere winter (Dec-Feb; DJF) temperature has increased @@ $^\circ$C/decade since 1979. The majority of this warming is attributed to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (@@cite) combined with positive feedbacks related to the loss of Arctic sea ice (@@cite). Epoch differences of surface air temperature (SAT) between 2002-12 and 1979-89 reveal warming upwards of 2$^\circ$C over the polar cap, collocated with areas of sea ice loss (Figure \ref{fig:fig1}a). Contemporaneous cooling of greater than 1$^\circ$C over the Eurasian continent in winter is striking against this general hemispheric warming. Figure \ref{fig:fig1}b shows that in the 11 years from 2002-12, 7 of the 10 coldest Eurasian winters occurred

, as it must overcome a significant anthropogenically forced warming signal.
