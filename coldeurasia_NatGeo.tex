\begin{abstract}
Arctic sea ice loss has been implicated in the recent trend toward unusually cold Eurasian winters \cite{liu12,mori14,kim14}. Whether the linkage follows from anthropogenic sea ice loss, however, remains an open question as the sea-ice loss combines anthropogenic response and internal (random) variability \cite{swart15,wettstein14} and because of confounding wintertime variability over the Eurasian continent \cite{deser12b,screen14a}. Here, we isolate the anthropogenic and random components of the linkage using a large ensemble of atmosphere-only model simulations with prescribed sea ice loss taken from simulations of the companion atmosphere-ocean-cryosphere model. We find no evidence of a sea-ice loss related decrease in Eurasian winter temperature. However, we do find long periods of winter Eurasian cooling linked to internally-generated circulation features over the Barents and Kara Seas regions of the Arctic. These results challenge the perception that Arctic sea ice loss was responsible for the recent prevalence of unusually cold Eurasian winters, showing instead that these winters were more likely the consequence of internal variability, with implications for our understanding of impacts and adaptation in human and natural high-northern latitude systems. %We find no evidence of a sea-ice loss related increase in the prevalence of cold Eurasian winters.
\end{abstract}

Average northern hemisphere winter (December-February; DJF) temperature has increased @@ $^\circ$C/decade since 1979. The majority of this warming is attributed to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (@@cite) combined with positive feedbacks related to the loss of Arctic sea ice (@@cite). Epoch differences of surface air temperature (SAT) between 2002-12 and 1979-89 reveal warming upward of 2$^\circ$C over the polar cap, collocated with areas of sea ice loss (Figure \ref{fig:fig1}a). Contemporaneous cooling of greater than 1$^\circ$C over the Eurasian continent in winter is also evident. This feature is particularly striking when considered in the context of broad hemispheric warming. Eurasian winters show a greater prevalence of anomalous cold since the year 2000 in relation to the evolution of northern hemisphere temperature (Figure \ref{fig:fig1}b).   

%Figure \ref{fig:fig1}b shows the evolution of Eurasian winter SAT with hemispheric SAT removed to highlight the growing anomalous Eurasian cooling against hemispheric warming. Since 1979, eight of ten of the coldest Eurasian winters have occurred since the year 2000.

The recent tendency toward anomalously cold Eurasian winters has coincided with large reductions in autumn and winter sea ice area in the Barents and Kara Seas sector of the Arctic (along the eastern half of the Russian coastline); the nine lowest years have occurred since 2000 (Figure \ref{fig:fig1}c). Low sea ice concentration in the Barents-Kara Seas (BKS) has been linked to anomalously cold Eurasian SAT through a Rossby wave-train emanating out of the BKS region, incited by turbulent heat flux from an increased area of open water \cite{honda09,mori14,kim14,peings14}. However, while human influence on observed Arctic sea ice extent is clear \cite{min08}, interpretation of this Arctic sea ice--Eurasian SAT connection as an anthropogenic signal is limited by the strong imprint of internal variability on observed sea ice loss itself \cite{swart15}; internal variability may contribute approximately 50\% of the magnitude of the observed trend \cite{stroeve07,kay11}.

A clear anthropogenic signal in Arctic sea ice area changes during winter since 1979 is also evident in a comparison of a 50-member ensemble of simulations performed in the Canadian Earth System Model v2 (CanESM2) forced with all historical forcings (Historical; see Methods) versus 50 CanESM2 simulations forced with only natural forcings (HistoricalNat; Figure \ref{fig:fig2}). Whereas natural forcing yields nearly equal chances of sea-ice growth and sea-ice loss between (2002-12) and (1979-89), including anthropogenic forcing always yields sea-ice loss even in the face of large internal variability as indicated by the spread in the Historical distribution. Simulated Historical winter Arctic sea-ice area anomalies are consistent with satellite measurements of the Arctic sea-ice area anomaly from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). 


%Observations represent one potential reality out of many possibilities due to the random evolution of internally-generated variability super-imposed on a forced .%, although observations fall on the less-ice-loss side of the distribution.

%An observational estimate of sea ice loss from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) is consistent with simulated Arctic sea ice loss, however we note that the Historical large ensemble (LE) average overestimates observed winter sea ice loss.

%Observations represent one potential reality out of many, and thus are not expected to fall in any particular place on the Historical distribution, however the CanESM2 Historical ensemble compares favourably with the NSIDC observations.

Observations represent just one potential reality out of many due to the evolution of internally-generated (``random") variability superimposed on a human-induced (``forced") evolution. We isolate the effect of human-induced Arctic sea ice loss on the atmosphere by executing a large ensemble of Canadian atmosphere general circulation model (CanAM4) simulations in which prescribed past (1979-89) and present-day (2002-12) boundary conditions are taken from an average of five CanESM2 Historical simulations (Figure \ref{fig:fig2} and Supplementary Figure 1; also see Methods). The average boundary conditions represent an estimate of the human-induced component by averaging out internal variability. 

A set of five 120-year AGCM simulations, differing only in initial conditions, is executed with annually-repeating, monthly sea-ice concentration (SIC), sea-ice thickness (SIT), and sea surface temperature (SST) for ``past" boundary conditions and for ``present-day" boundary conditions in which the only changes are Arctic SIC, SIT, and SST (where SIC $<$ 15\% in the present day but not the past). The anomalies between these ``Average SIC forcing" past and present-day simulations estimate the isolated response of the atmosphere to human-induced sea ice loss. We similarly execute five pairs of 120-year AGCM simulations with boundary conditions taken from the individual CanESM2 Historical simulations (``Individual SIC forcing" ensemble) to represent the response to varying boundary conditions that incorporate internal variability. Thus in total, each ensemble consists of 600 years of (present - past) anomalies. In addition, we execute a pair of 120-year simulations with past and present-day NSIDC boundary conditions (Supplementary Figure 1).

We first present the responses of regionally-averaged winter SAT from all simulations as ``uncertainty cascades" \cite{wilby10,swart15}, where uncertainty is based on the number of simulation years averaged (Figure \ref{fig:fig3}). This presentation demonstrates the powerful influence of internal variability. A reduction in SIC reveals newly open seawater that provides a source of heat to the atmosphere. Thus, the local effect of human-induced sea ice loss, averaged across the Average SIC forcing ensemble (600-year average), is a warming over the polar cap (averaged north of 60$^\circ$N) of just over 1$^\circ$C in winter (bottom of Figure \ref{fig:fig3}a). When considering instead the 120-year averaged SAT responses to Average SIC forcing, a spread in responses is evident that ranges from $~$0.9$^\circ$C to 1.3$^\circ$C. The spread of 60-year averages is larger still. 

This spread is noteworthy because, given the identical boundary conditions for each 120-year and 60-year average, the range of anomalies must be due solely to internal variability. Furthermore, the range of 120-year average SAT responses in the Individual SIC forcing ensemble (top of Figure \ref{fig:fig3}a) is comparable to that of the Average SIC forcing ensemble, indicating that even local sensitivity of SAT to varied sea ice loss conditions is overpowered by internal variability in winter.    % @@ supplementary to show it is not the case in SON?

%two reasons: i. because the boundary conditions for each 120-year and 60-year average are identical, the driver of the differences must be solely internal variability, and ii. each anomaly presented (600-year, 120-year, and 60-year average) is statistically significant at the 90\% level. The implication is that  one could be mislead as to the true response if a simulation was stopped after just 60-years, or even 100, as has been common practice (@@). 
%previous findings indicate that 60 years is sufficient to determine a robust, local SAT response to sea-ice loss (e.g. Ref. \cite{screen14a}), which these results do not support. Furthermore, the range of 120-year average SAT responses in the Individual SIC forcing ensemble is comparable to that of the Average SIC forcing ensemble, indicating that sensitivity of SAT to varied sea ice loss conditions is overpowered by internal variability, even locally, in winter. 
%Furthermore, each anomaly presented (600-year, 120-year, and 60-year average) is statistically significant at the 90\% level, which would lead one to believe
%--- for example, the 60-year average of the present day polar cap SAT is significantly different from the past polar cap SAT. Thus, 

Moving farther afield, the SAT response over Eurasia is not statistically different from zero in either the Individual or Average SIC forcing ensemble averages, indicating that the robust response of Eurasian winter temperature to human-induced Arctic sea-ice loss is not cooling, but rather no signal (Figure \ref{fig:fig3}b). Nevertheless, some 120-year and 60-year average anomalies show statistical significance, most notably the 60-year average cooling associated with NSIDC SIC forcing that is not robust to the 120-year average. This point is important to recognize because many studies understandably utilize 60- to 100-year integrations to draw conclusions that may prove inaccurate given larger ensemble sizes.

Arctic sea ice loss can yield either warmer or cooler Eurasian SAT in winter, even with a large ensemble size of 120-years each, and even with identical boundary forcing (Figure \ref{fig:fig3}b). To understand this further, we examine the spatial pattern of circulation associated with the two ``extreme" cases of cold and warm SAT anomalies in the Average SIC forcing ensemble (Figure \ref{fig:fig4}). It is immediately apparent that the patterns of geopotential height at 500 hPa (Z500) are quite different from one another, and in some locations, nearly opposite. The cooling case (Figure \ref{fig:fig4}a) shows a zonally-symmetric increase in Z500 to the north and a weak decrease over central Eurasia. In contrast, the warming case (Figure \ref{fig:fig4}b) exhibits an azonal pattern with a decrease in Z500 over the BKS region and increases over the southern continent and the northeast. This pattern favours warm-moist air advection from the south and west.

% This pattern is conducive for advection of polar air to the south and west along Z500 contours, and is particularly favourable in the region just over and south of the Barents-Kara Seas, just visible in the north-northcenter of the image. 
%, in which the boundary forcings are identical between 120-year averages. 

concluding remarks should include: something about how if sea-ice loss does nudge Eurasian SAT in one way or another, the signal would be much too small in reality to distinguish from natural variability anyway.

%Focusing on winter, we contrast the local response of SAT over the polar cap (Figure \ref{fig:fig3}a) with the remote response of Eurasian SAT (Figure \ref{fig:fig3}b)

%We first examine the response of SAT over the polar cap (averaged north of 60$^\circ$N) where it is local to the sea ice loss. Newly open seawaters provide a source of heat to the atmosphere, causing it to warm --- the Average SIC forcing ensemble mean, indicative of the response to human-induced sea ice loss, is a warming over the polar cap in winter (Figure \ref{fig:fig3}a). 

%The response of SAT in winter over the polar cap (averaged north of 60$^\circ$N) to human-induced sea ice loss is warming of just over 1$^\circ$C, indicated by the Average SIC forcing ensemble mean in Figure \ref{fig:fig3}a. 

%We show the response of regionally averaged SAT as an ``uncertainty cascade" \cite{wilby10,swart15} where uncertainty is based on number of years averaged. This presentation demonstrates the powerful and sometimes misleading effect of internal variability.

The average boundary conditions represent an estimate of the human-induced component of the boundary condition by averaging out internal variability. Pairs of simulations are executed with the CanESM2's associated Canadian AGCM (CanAM4) in which past (1979-89) and present-day (2002-12) Arctic sea-ice conditions from the five CanESM2 Historical ensemble members that are included as part of CMIP5 (Figure \ref{fig:fig2}) are prescribed as boundary conditions (see Methods).

%Interpretation of the connection between observed Arctic sea ice loss and cold Eurasian SAT is further complicated by the imprint of internal variability on the sea ice loss itself \cite{swart15}, which may contribute approximately 50\% to the magnitude of the observed trend \cite{stroeve07,kay11}. %Thus, much of the 'forcing' in earlier work, the observed sea ice change, is itself due to internal variability. A critical question remains: Has human-induced sea ice loss caused colder Eurasian winter temperatures?
