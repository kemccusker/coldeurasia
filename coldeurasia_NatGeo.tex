\begin{abstract}
Arctic sea ice loss has been implicated in the recent trend toward unusually cold Eurasian winters \cite{liu12,mori14,kim14}. Whether the linkage follows from anthropogenic sea ice loss, however, remains an open question as the sea-ice loss combines anthropogenic response and internal (random) variability \cite{swart15,wettstein14} and because of confounding wintertime variability over the Eurasian continent \cite{deser12b,screen14a}. Here, we isolate the anthropogenic and random components of the linkage using a large ensemble of atmosphere-only model simulations with prescribed sea ice loss taken from simulations of the companion atmosphere-ocean-cryosphere model. We find no evidence of a sea-ice loss related decrease in Eurasian winter temperature. However, we do find long periods of winter Eurasian cooling linked to internally-generated circulation features over the Barents and Kara Seas regions of the Arctic. These results challenge the perception that Arctic sea ice loss was responsible for the recent prevalence of unusually cold Eurasian winters, showing instead that these winters were more likely the consequence of internal variability, with implications for our understanding of impacts and adaptation in human and natural high-northern latitude systems. %We find no evidence of a sea-ice loss related increase in the prevalence of cold Eurasian winters.
\end{abstract}

Average northern hemisphere winter (December-February; DJF) temperature has increased @@ $^\circ$C/decade since 1979. The majority of this warming is attributed to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (@@cite) combined with positive feedbacks related to the loss of Arctic sea ice (@@cite). Epoch differences of surface air temperature (SAT) between 2002-12 and 1979-89 reveal warming upward of 2$^\circ$C over the polar cap, collocated with areas of sea ice loss (Figure \ref{fig:fig1}a). Contemporaneous cooling of greater than 1$^\circ$C over the Eurasian continent in winter is also evident. This feature is particularly striking when considered in the context of broad hemispheric warming. Eurasian winters show a greater prevalence of anomalous cold since the year 2000 in relation to the evolution of northern hemisphere temperature (Figure \ref{fig:fig1}b).   

%Figure \ref{fig:fig1}b shows the evolution of Eurasian winter SAT with hemispheric SAT removed to highlight the growing anomalous Eurasian cooling against hemispheric warming. Since 1979, eight of ten of the coldest Eurasian winters have occurred since the year 2000.

The recent tendency toward anomalously cold Eurasian winters has coincided with large reductions in autumn and winter sea ice area in the Barents and Kara Seas sector of the Arctic (along the eastern half of the Russian coastline); the nine lowest years have occurred since 2000 (Figure \ref{fig:fig1}c). Low sea ice concentration in the Barents-Kara Seas (BKS) has been linked to anomalously cold Eurasian SAT through a Rossby wave-train emanating out of the BKS region, incited by turbulent heat flux from an increased area of open water \cite{honda09,mori14,kim14,peings14}. However, while human influence on observed Arctic sea ice extent is clear \cite{min08}, interpretation of this Arctic sea ice--Eurasian SAT connection as an anthropogenic signal is limited by the strong imprint of internal variability on observed sea ice loss itself \cite{swart15}; internal variability may contribute approximately 50\% of the magnitude of the observed trend \cite{stroeve07,kay11}.

A clear anthropogenic signal in Arctic sea ice area changes during winter since 1979 is also evident in a comparison of a 50-member ensemble of simulations performed in the Canadian Earth System Model v2 (CanESM2) forced with all historical forcings (Historical; see Methods) versus 50 CanESM2 simulations forced with only natural forcings (HistoricalNat; Figure \ref{fig:fig2}). Whereas natural forcing yields nearly equal chances of sea-ice growth and sea-ice loss between (2002-12) and (1979-89), including anthropogenic forcing always yields sea-ice loss even in the face of large internal variability as indicated by the spread in the Historical distribution. Simulated Historical winter Arctic sea-ice area anomalies are consistent with satellite measurements of the Arctic sea-ice area anomaly from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). 


%Observations represent one potential reality out of many possibilities due to the random evolution of internally-generated variability super-imposed on a forced .%, although observations fall on the less-ice-loss side of the distribution.

%An observational estimate of sea ice loss from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) is consistent with simulated Arctic sea ice loss, however we note that the Historical large ensemble (LE) average overestimates observed winter sea ice loss.

%Observations represent one potential reality out of many, and thus are not expected to fall in any particular place on the Historical distribution, however the CanESM2 Historical ensemble compares favourably with the NSIDC observations.

Observations represent just one potential reality out of many due to the evolution of internally-generated (``random") variability superimposed on a human-induced (``forced") evolution. We isolate the effect of human-induced Arctic sea ice loss on the atmosphere by executing a large ensemble of simulations in an atmosphere general circulation model (AGCM) in which prescribed past (1979-89) and present-day (2002-12) boundary conditions are taken from an average of five CanESM2 Historical simulations (Figure \ref{fig:fig2}; also see Methods). The average boundary conditions represent an estimate of the human-induced component by averaging out internal variability. A set of five 120-year AGCM simulations, differing only in initial conditions, is executed with annually-repeating, monthly sea-ice concentration (SIC), sea-ice thickness (SIT), and sea surface temperature (SST) for ``past" boundary conditions and for ``present-day" boundary conditions where the only changes are Arctic SIC, SIT and local SST (where SIC $<$ 15\% in the present day but not the past). The anomalies between these ``Average SIC forcing" simulation pairs estimate the isolated response of the atmosphere to human-induced sea ice loss. We similarly execute five pairs of 120-year AGCM simulations with boundary conditions taken from the individual CanESM2 Historical simulations (``Individual SIC forcing" ensemble) to represent the response to varying boundary conditions that incorporate internal variability. Thus in total, each ensemble consists of 600 years of (present - past) anomalies.

 

 %as well as demonstrate the powerful and sometimes misleading effect of internal variability 

%by prescribing to an atmosphere general circulation model (AGCM) sea-ice concentration (SIC), sea-ice thickness (SIT), and sea-surface temperature (SST) boundary conditions that are an ensemble average of five historical simulations from a fully-coupled global climate model (Figure \ref{fig:fig2}; also see Methods). The average boundary conditions represent an estimate of the human-induced component of the boundary condition by averaging out internal variability. Pairs of simulations are executed with the CanESM2's associated Canadian AGCM (CanAM4) in which past (1979-89) and present-day (2002-12) Arctic sea-ice conditions from the five CanESM2 Historical ensemble members that are included as part of CMIP5 (Figure \ref{fig:fig2}) are prescribed as boundary conditions (see Methods). 

%While the number of realizations averaged is small, it is 



%Interpretation of this connection as an anthropogenic signal, however, is limited by the strong imprint of internal variability on observed sea ice loss \cite{swart15}, which may contribute approximately 50\% of the magnitude of the observed trend \cite{stroeve07,kay11}.

%Human influence on observed Arctic sea ice extent since the early 1990's is clear \cite{min08}

%However, the magnitude, timing, and structural details of the Eurasian cooling differ between these findings and do not fully explain observed Eurasian cooling.

%Interpretation of the connection between observed Arctic sea ice loss and cold Eurasian SAT is further complicated by the imprint of internal variability on the sea ice loss itself \cite{swart15}, which may contribute approximately 50\% to the magnitude of the observed trend \cite{stroeve07,kay11}. %Thus, much of the 'forcing' in earlier work, the observed sea ice change, is itself due to internal variability. A critical question remains: Has human-induced sea ice loss caused colder Eurasian winter temperatures?
