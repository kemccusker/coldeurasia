\begin{abstract}
Observed Arctic sea ice loss has been implicated in the recent prevalence of anomalously cold winters in Eurasia. Whether this linkage is a robust feature of anthropogenic sea ice loss, however, remains an open question because observed sea ice loss is due to a combination of external (human-induced) forcing and internal (random) variability. The interpretation of any warm Arctic-cold Eurasia linkages is further complicated by large wintertime internal variability over midlatitude land in observations and in atmospheric model simulations that attempt to isolate the response to sea ice loss. Here we execute two large ensembles ($>$600 years per ensemble) of simulations in an atmospheric general circulation model with prescribed historical sea ice loss taken from five historical simulations in the associated coupled global climate model in order to isolate the impact of past human-induced sea ice loss, as distinct from observed sea ice loss, on Eurasian temperature. We find the average Eurasian temperature response is negligible due to human-induced sea ice loss, however we find long periods (120 years) of both significant warming and cooling over Eurasia in early winter, linked to geopotential height anomalies over the Barents-Kara Seas region of the Arctic. This suggests that observed cold winters are largely due to internal variability in the sea ice itself combined with internal variability in the response to human-induced sea ice loss.

%\section{Introduction}

Internal variability in the climate system plays an important role in determining the evolution of Arctic sea-ice extent (cite Wettstein14, Swart15), contributing approximately 50\% to the magnitude of the observed trend (cite Stroeve07, Kay11). Recent reductions in Arctic sea-ice area (cite@@) have coincided with an apparent prevalence of colder wintertime surface air temperature over Eurasian land surfaces (cite@@), prompting associations to be drawn in the literature between the two observed phenomena (cite Francis12,Mori14, Kim14, Inoue12, Overland11, Liu12,Petoukhov10,Honda09,Peings13). Given that internal variability in surface air temperature (SAT) in the mid-latitudes is very large (cite Deser12) and much of the sea ice change itself is also due to internal variability, linkages drawn from observations do not tell us anything about the influence that human-induced sea-ice loss has on Eurasian SAT.

Here we aim to isolate the effect of human-induced sea-ice loss on the atmosphere because i. the anthropogenic signal is theoretically identifiable and robust whereas internal variability is by definition chaotic, and ii. the anthropogenic signal will likely continue to grow, potentially emerging from the noise of internal variability. The histograms of November-December averaged sea ice area anomalies between 2002-12 and 1979-89 from two large ensembles executed with the Canadian Earth System Model version 2 (CanESM2) shown in Figure 1 highlight the clear signal of anthropogenic forcing (separation of Historical and HistoricalNat distributions) as well as the role of internal variability (spread of each distribution). 

Figure 1, which shows histograms of November-December averaged sea ice area anomalies between 2002-12 and 1979-89 from two large ensembles executed with the Canadian Earth System Model version 2 (CanESM2), shows t the clear signal of anthropogenic sea ice-

We do this by executing two large ensembles of paired simulations (1979-89 average boundary conditions and 2001-12 average boundary conditions) with prescribed Arctic sea ice concentration (SIC) and sea surface temperature (SST) boundary conditions. One ensemble ('Variable SIC forcings') is made up of five 

Sea ice loss in the Barents and Kara Seas region (BKS) has been pointed to as a primary driver of anomalously cold Eurasian surface air tempuratures (SAT) through Rossby wave propagation incited by increased surface heat fluxes (Peings13,Kim14,Mori14,Honda09).

Eurasian surface air temperature (SAT) is particularly sensitive to sea ice loss in the Barents and Kara Seas (BKS) region

 While associations do not imply causation, Physical mechanisms   .. well-supported by modelling ...

Red markers indicate the original five Historical simulations, published as part of CMIP5 and seeds for the Historical LE, and also prescribed as boundary conditions to our 'Individual SIC forcings' AGCM simulations. Black markers are as red except for the HistoricalNat simulations. Green and blue markers show Arctic sea-ice change from two observational datasets. Filled markers indicate the present day period (2002-12) is significantly different from the past (1979-89) at the 95\% level using the Student's T test of difference between two means.

\section{Discussion}

We emphasize that these results do not contradict studies that show physical mechanisms consistent with Arctic sea-ice loss causing colder Eurasian SAT in winter. 

While observed Arctic sea-ice loss may well be connected to recent colder Eurasian winters, our results suggest that it is a factor of internal variability --- both in response to sea-ice loss and potentially in the sea ice loss pattern itself --- or due to other factors such as North Atlantic sea surface temperatures (cite Peings14, Sato14). We find that the robust response to human-induced sea-ice loss is a slight warming that is not statistically different from zero $^\circ$C.
